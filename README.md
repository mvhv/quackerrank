# Quackerrank
A social web-app that ranks Australian waterbirds using graph centrality analysis.

Initially developed as Python/Flask app, this is a rebuild using a MERN stack. Intended as a small portfolio piece demonstrating web-development and basic graph theory. No React classes are used, all front-end components are functional with state and lifecycle managed through hooks.

The ranking categories are intentionally nonsensical, but graph analysis allows for "meaningful" results even on very sparse datasets.
